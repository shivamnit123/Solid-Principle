# 😂 SOLID Principles (Explained Like You're 5)

### 1️⃣ S - Single Responsibility  
**One person, one job.**  
Don’t make the chef take your order, cook, and clean the plates too!

---

### 2️⃣ O - Open/Closed  
**You can decorate it, but don’t break it.**  
Like your mom's living room—add new cushions, but *don’t move the furniture.*

---

### 3️⃣ L - Liskov Substitution  
**Swapping should work.**  
If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck... don’t replace it with a chicken!

---

### 4️⃣ I - Interface Segregation  
**Don’t give people a remote with 100 buttons.**  
Just give them the buttons they actually use: *Power*, *Volume*, *Netflix*.

---

### 5️⃣ D - Dependency Inversion  
**Don’t depend on the brand, depend on the type.**  
Like: “I need a charger,” not “I need an Apple 67W charger made in 2021 with USB-C.”

---

> 💡 TL;DR: Make your code like a good team—clear roles, flexible, replaceable, and not bossy 😎
